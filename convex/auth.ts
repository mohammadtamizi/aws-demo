/**
 * Authentication Configuration for Convex
 *
 * This file would typically contain authentication configuration for Convex,
 * such as setting up Clerk, Auth0, or other authentication providers.
 *
 * After removing Clerk authentication, this file is now a placeholder for:
 * - Future authentication setup
 * - Custom authorization rules
 * - User identity management
 *
 * For AWS demo purposes, authentication has been simplified.
 */

// This file is now empty after removing Clerk authentication
// You can add your own authentication logic here in the future if needed
