# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please follow these steps to report it:

1. **Do not** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed.
2. Email your findings to security@example.com, or create a confidential issue in this repository.
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability, including:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if available)

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report as soon as possible and will work with you to understand and address the issue.

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### General Guidelines

1. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Never commit sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or tokens directly in the code.
2. **Use Environment Variables**: Store sensitive information in environment variables or AWS Parameter Store.
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Always assign the minimum necessary permissions to IAM roles and policies.
4. **Code Review**: All code changes must go through peer review with security considerations in mind.
5. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

### AWS Specific Guidelines

1. **VPC Configuration**:
   - Place resources in private subnets whenever possible
   - Use security groups with minimal inbound/outbound rules
   - Enable VPC Flow Logs for network traffic monitoring

2. **IAM Best Practices**:
   - Create custom IAM policies following least privilege principles
   - Avoid using the AWS managed policies when more specific permissions can be defined
   - Regularly rotate access keys and credentials

3. **S3 Security**:
   - Always configure S3 buckets with appropriate access controls
   - Enable server-side encryption for sensitive data
   - Implement lifecycle policies for data retention

4. **ECS/Container Security**:
   - Scan container images for vulnerabilities before deployment
   - Use non-root users inside containers
   - Apply resource limits to containers to prevent DoS attacks

5. **Load Balancer Security**:
   - Use HTTPS instead of HTTP for all traffic
   - Configure security groups to restrict traffic to load balancers
   - Implement WAF rules to protect against common web exploits

### CI/CD Security Practices

1. **Secrets Management**:
   - Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive information in workflows
   - Consider using OIDC for AWS authentication instead of long-lived credentials

2. **Build Pipeline Security**:
   - Include security scanning in the CI/CD pipeline:
     - Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
     - Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
     - Container scanning
     - Infrastructure as Code scanning

3. **Deployment Approval**:
   - Require manual approval for production deployments
   - Implement separation of duties for sensitive environments

## Security Tools Used in This Project

1. **Dependency Scanning**: npm audit for identifying vulnerabilities in dependencies
2. **Secret Scanning**: GitLeaks for preventing accidental commits of secrets
3. **Container Scanning**: Trivy for scanning Docker images
4. **IaC Scanning**: tfsec for analyzing Terraform code
5. **SAST**: SonarCloud for static code analysis

## Compliance and Documentation

1. **Maintain Security Documentation**: Keep this document updated with current security practices
2. **Document Security Incidents**: Record and learn from any security incidents
3. **Regularly Review Configurations**: Conduct periodic reviews of security configurations and permissions
